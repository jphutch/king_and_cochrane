Despite these expectations, the evidence to date on the uptake and impacts of insurance is mixed. This paper steps back and considers theoretically where index insurance might be most effective, and whether it should be offered as a standalone contract, or explicitly interlinked with credit contracts. Emerging from this analysis is a set of nuanced recommendations based on the structure of risk and the property rights (collateral) environment.},

However, adoption levels of these technologies have remained disappointingly low in Africa. This paper analyzes the effect of access to credit on the likelihood of adoption and use intensity of chemical fertilizers using data from large rural surveys in Ethiopia. Using a heteroscedasticity-based identification strategy to address the endogenous nature of access to credit, we find that access to credit has significant positive effects on adoption and intensity of use of chemical fertilizers. However, important heterogeneities are observed. Credit obtained from formal sources is more important for the intensity of use than for the decision to adopt chemical fertilizers. Credit taken with the primary purpose of financing agricultural inputs is more likely to promote adoption of chemical fertilizers than credit taken per se. Furthermore, reported credit effects are larger when estimated against the sample of credit-constrained non-users as compared with the pool of the whole sample of credit non-users. The results remain robust to several sensitivity analyses. Our results yield useful implications for the design, promotion, and targeting of credit services to leverage their effect on adoption of agricultural technologies.},

Given minimal changes in adoption of relatively expensive inputs, we attribute these gains to improved cultivation methods that require low upfront monetary investment.

Decentralized models assume that information flows from researchers to extension workers, and from extension agents to contact farmers (CFs). CFs should then train other farmers in their communities. Such a modality may fail to address informational inefficiencies and accountability issues. We run a field experiment to measure the impact of augmenting the CF model with a direct CF training on the diffusion of a new technology. All villages have CFs and access the same extension network. In treatment villages, CFs additionally receive a three-day, central training on the new technology. We track information transmission through two nodes of the extension network: from extension agents to CFs, and from CFs to other farmers. Directly training CFs leads to a large, statistically significant increase in adoption among CFs. However, higher levels of CF adoption have limited impact on the behavior of other farmers.},

On the other hand, there have been increasing numbers of studies on social network or farmer-to-farmer technology extension. These studies explore more efficient extension systems than traditional public-sector extension approaches.

Historians of comparative race relations have used Poe's proposal as an example of the intellectual exchanges between South Africa and the US South. This article reinterprets Poe's segregation campaign by placing it in the context of his decade-long engagement with the transnational Country Life Movement that spanned the Atlantic in the years before World War I. While visiting England, Ireland, and Denmark, Poe engaged with prominent romantic agrarian thinkers and encountered scenes of a harmonious, beautiful, and prosperous Anglo-Saxon country life that he longed for the South to emulate. In light of these influences, Poe's fight to remove blacks from the rural South had less to do with imported racial ideas and more with Poe's commitment to recreating the Irish countryside in the South. It was Poe's romantic agrarianism that inspired him to spearhead what was, by all accounts, an economically misguided and morally repugnant policy.},

Exploiting climate-based variation in cotton production, I show that cotton specialization in the late 19th century had a negative impact on local development that lasts through 2010. This negative relationship, however, only became evident in the second half of the 20th century. I argue that the change was caused by the mechanization of cotton production, which began in the 1950s. After the mechanization, local manufacturing absorbed displaced cotton tenants with low human capital. In response to the inflow of cotton tenants, labor productivity in manufacturing began to decline and the effects persisted in the long-run. The persistent decline in manufacturing productivity is explained by directed technical change that reduced demand for skills in manufacturing. These results indicate that, depending on the agricultural background, structural change can negatively affect the evolution of technology and productivity in the industrial sector.},

We analyze the impact of decoupled and other farm program payments on farmland values.

            If agricultural subsidies are largely capitalized into farmland values through their effect on rental rates, then expanding support for agriculture may not benefit farmers who rent the land they farm. Existing evidence on the incidence of subsidies on cash rental rates is mixed. Identification is obscured by unobserved or imprecisely measured factors that tend to be correlated with subsidies, especially land quality and time‐varying factors like commodity prices and adverse weather events. A problem that has received less attention is the fact that subsidies and land quality on rented land may differ from owned land. Since most farms possess both rented and owned acreage, farm‐level measures of subsidies, land values, and rental rates may bias estimated incidence. Using a new, field‐level data set that, for the first time, precisely links subsidies to land parcels, we show that this bias is considerable: where farm‐level estimates suggest an incidence of 42–49 cents of the marginal subsidy dollar, field‐level estimates from the same farms indicate that landlords capture just 20–28 cents. The size of the farm and the duration of the rental arrangement have substantial effects. Incidence falls by 5–15 cents when doubling total operated acres, and the incidence falls by 0.1–0.8 cents with each additional year of the rental arrangement. Low incidence of subsidies on rents combined with the farm‐size and duration effects suggest that farmers renting land have monopsony power.},

	abstract = {Where is Martin Luther King, Jr. when we need him?  So much has changed since the glory days of the civil rights movement -- and so much has stayed the same. African Americans command their place at every level of society, from the lunch counter to the college campus to the corporate boardroom -- yet the gap between the American middle class and the black poor is as wide as ever. Hollywood casts a black actor as president of the United States without provoking a word of protest, but a black man is savagely dragged to his death because of the color of his skin. The hip-hop culture that springs from the imaginations of urban black youth (who are themselves reviled and feared) sweeps across the malls and high schools of suburbia, yet black students still sit together, apart, in the cafeteria. Where can we turn to find the vision that will guide us through these strange and difficult times? Michael Eric Dyson helps us find the answer in our recent past, by resurrecting the "true" Martin Luther King, Jr.  A private citizen who transformed the world around him, King was arguably the greatest American who ever lived. Yet, as Dyson so poignantly reveals, Martin Luther King, Jr. has disappeared in plain sight. Despite the federal holiday, the postage stamps, and the required reference in history textbooks, King's vitality and complexity have faded from view. Young people do not learn how radical he was, liberals forget that he despaired of whites even as he loved them, and contemporary black leaders tend to ignore the powerful forces that shaped him -- the black church, language, and sexuality -- thereby obscuring his relevance to black youth and hip-hop culture. Instead, King's legacyhas become a battlefield on which various forces wage war -- whether it is conservatives who appropriate his words to combat affirmative action, or the King family themselves, who want to control use of the great man's words for a fee.  Former welfare dad, Princeton Ph.D., and Baptist preacher, Michael Eric Dyson sets out to find the man who was assassinated when Dyson himself was a nine-year-old boy living in downtown Detroit. And in his quest to unravel the meaning of King, Dyson discovers that the very contradictions embodied in the slain leader's life make him a man for our times. He returns to us a man as radical in his view of social injustice as Malcolm X, who still won the support of the white establishment; a man dedicated to the common good, who gave in to his own appetites; a master of language and rhetoric, who "sampled" the words and ideas of others; a man who despised the unjust distribution of wealth and used its fruits to feed his own people. Dyson rescues from history a Martin Luther King, Jr. who matters "today: " a man who has as much in common with rap artist Tupac Shakur as he does with the Reverend Ralph Abernathy. Unafraid to confront King's personal life, determined to defend King from the sanitizing forces of historical amnesia, Michael Eric Dyson challenges us to embrace the man who said, prophetically, on the eve of his death, "I May Not Get There With You," and to make him our partner in our ongoing struggle to get to the Promised Land.},

Using new micro-data from Louisiana, we examine the factors that led to successful homesteading. We compare homesteaders to the agricultural population, finding few differences other than wealth. A disproportionate percentage of homesteaders were white. We substantiate some of the claims put forth in the earlier literature, such as large amounts of fraud. Further, we present a more nuanced interpretation of a greater success rate for African-Americans. Being local or non-local had no meaningful impact on white success rates but had a large impact on African-Americans. Local African-Americans were more likely to obtain title to their land while non-local African-Americans were less likely to succeed. We hypothesize that regional knowledge, kinship networks, and white resistance to non-local African-Americans are possible explanations for this racial difference.},

The launching of BERC occurred within a period of far-reaching social change and the Vietnam War era. During this time, Robert Browne also was a national leader of the Vietnam anti-war movement and one of the first public intellectuals to establish a link between the civil rights movement and the peace movement. An argument is developed that this background provided as much impetus to Robert Browne for the creation of BERC and The Review as did the black nationalist programs and conferences of that era. During his eleven year tenure as Director at BERC, he pioneered ground-breaking research on the status of black-owned land in the south; consulted with community development corporations, black-owned businesses and banks; and prompted innovations in modern black philanthropy through the establishment of the Twenty-First Century Foundation. The origin and justification for The Review of Black Political Economy and the early activities and meetings of the Caucus and NEA are emphasized. In addition, an effort is made to include an enumeration of the earliest contributors to BERC, the NEA, and The Review – many of whom have not been mentioned in previous retrospectives.},

Browne it's Chair, and it's political, economic and policy impact on both public and private institutions, which for the most part, restricted and undermined the aspirations of black's to own and benefit from landownership. It is also about the positive impact ELF had on rural black landowners, taking the form of organized networks challenging the discriminatory and land grabbing practices of both public and private sector actors. Robert S. Browne was a Man ahead of his time and a giant in the eyes of many who have follow his example today with asset development strategies that benefit communities of color.},

            Using a large‐scale, individual‐level administrative data set for 2008–2021, we document the inequality in farm program payments across all recipients in the U.S. By examining the relationship between within‐county inequality and demographic characteristics of farmers in a county, we find that there is a positive association between the share of Black operators and within‐county inequality. We also provide suggestive evidence that a substantial portion of racial and gender disparities in farm payments are associated with crop production characteristics. We then utilize name information in farm payment data to infer the race and gender of individual payees. The analysis using approximately 4.9 million payee‐by‐year observations and predicted race and gender information of those payees shows that payments are lower for producers who are Black, Hispanic, and female. Our study provides a comprehensive empirical analysis of the equality of farm subsidy distribution covering most U.S. farm payment programs at a granular level over time. We also provide an empirical approach of utilizing name information from the administrative data that opens up more possibilities for racial and gender inequity research in agricultural economics.},

Although some African Americans succeeded in gaining homesteaded land, most were unable to take advantage of the Southern Homestead Act because of their extreme poverty; the unsuitability of the lands available and difficulty of finding them; and the extreme hostility and violence that whites directed against them.

	abstract = {This book unearths a food story buried deep within the soil of American civil rights history. Drawing on archival research, interviews, and oral histories, Bobby J. Smith II re-examines the Mississippi civil rights movement as a period when activists expanded the meaning of civil rights to address food as integral to sociopolitical and economic conditions. For decades, white economic and political actors used food as a weapon against Black sharecropping communities in the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta, but members of these communities collaborated with activists to transform food into a tool of resistance. Today, Black youth are building a food justice movement in the Delta to continue this story, grappling with inequalities that continue to shape their lives. Drawing on multiple disciplines including critical food studies, Black studies, history, sociology, and southern studies, Smith makes critical connections between civil rights activism and present-day food justice activism in Black communities, revealing how power struggles over food empower them to envision Black food futures in which communities have the full autonomy and capacity to imagine, design, create, and sustain a self-sufficient local food system.},

Land-grant colleges of this region were not "farm schools," and, indeed, were meant to offer a service distinct from the practical education most readily available to (and most often romanticized by later scholars) young men in rural America. The land-grant schools were premised on scientific education, high academic standards, and the training of professionals. Focusing on several newly created institutions, as well as some colleges of the Colonial and Early Republic eras that became land-grant schools, the book explores the social, political, and economic forces that propelled the land-grant movement in the Northeast states and the states of the Midwest where practical education predominated. These broad regional trends point toward a fundamental tension in the Morrill Act itself, which left implementation to the states. Mixing the promotion of science and middle-class professionalism while at the same time serving a population keel on marketable skills, paying jobs, and social equity (all encapsulated in the Grange Movement of the same era), land-grant colleges were fraught with ideological and practical difficulties. (This lack of a unified mission was further highlighted by questions of inclusion and role of women and African Americans.) These divisions are nowhere more present than in the land-grant colleges of the Northeast, and thus these institutions deserve special attention in a literature that has often associated the Morrill Act with the Grange Movement and focused on the institutions of the Midwest"-- Provided by publisher.},

	abstract = {Purpose
In recent years, socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers have increased their usage of nontraditional lending nearly converging to levels of usage observed for nonsocially disadvantaged groups. The purpose of this research is to explore explanations for this trend in lending utilization by socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers by examining factors that influence credit usage and credit choice.
A multinomial logit is used to estimate the probability of loan choice given characteristics of the producer and farm.
While not a causal analysis, the results suggest that farm characteristics, which differ between socially disadvantaged and nonsocially disadvantaged producers, are associated with a lower likelihood of credit usage by an average socially disadvantaged farmer. For those that have loans, socially disadvantaged producers exhibit higher debt-to-asset ratios and lower current ratios, characteristics that are typically associated with higher than observed probability of usage of loans other than nontraditional. Socially disadvantaged producers also have lower value of assets which is associated with a higher probability of nontraditional loan usage.
This research is among the first to examine loan usage of socially disadvantaged producers using nationally representative data.},

            This paper provides new insights on the distribution of agricultural government payments by farm operator race and the sources of disparities. We use farm‐level data from the Census of Agriculture to estimate the payments each farm was eligible to receive from the 2018 and 2019 Market Facilitation Program. We find that farms with a White operator were eligible to receive significantly more payments than farms with a non‐White operator. Most of the disparity for farms with a Black operator is due to differences in average farm size, because there are few large farms with a Black operator. The disparities for farms with an American Indian, Asian, or Pacific Islander operator were roughly half due to farm size and half due to the location of these farms and the types of commodities they tend to produce.},

Black ownership increased by 46 percentage points, whereas white ownership increased by 20 points. Remarkably, 25 of the 26 point narrowing occurred between 1870 and 1910. Part of this early convergence is accounted for by falling white ownership due to movement out of agriculture, but most is accounted for by post-emancipation gains among blacks. After 1910, white and black households increased ownership, but the racial gap barely changed. We discuss the influence of residential segregation, public policy, and permanent income on the ownership gap.},

Although some African Americans succeeded in gaining homesteaded land, most were unable to take advantage of the Southern Homestead Act because of their extreme poverty; the unsuitability of the lands available and difficulty of finding them; and the extreme hostility and violence that whites directed against them.

            This paper examines the payments made to minority producers, focused on African American producers, from the COVID‐19 program, Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP), of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and compares it with one of the other more recent ad hoc program payments, the Market Facilitation Program (MFP). There were two rounds of the CFAP, and combinedly (as of March 2022), the program made direct payments of \$31.0 billion (\$11.8 billion from CFAP 1 and \$19.2 billion from CFAP 2) starting in 2020. The MFP made a total payment of \$23.5 billion (in two rounds, MFP 2018 and MFP 2019) to producers affected by the retaliatory tariffs placed on US producers by trade partners across multiple years. CFAP made almost \$600 million in direct payments to minority producers, including Black or African American producers. Black or African American only producers received more than \$52 million in CFAP payments. CFAP payments were proportional to the value of agricultural commodity sold for most minority producers. The 2017 Census of Agriculture showed that the majority of minority producers, including African American producers but excluding Asian producers, raised livestock. CFAP made the highest payments to livestock minority producers. The CFAP payment distribution pattern shows that payments reached minority producers who often did not receive Government payments. CFAP made more payments and as a share of total program outlays to minority producers compared to MFP. However, for Black or African American only producers, even though the magnitude increased (because CFAP disbursed more funds compared to MFP), the share of payment received did not increase.},

In this paper, we use farm-level data from the Census of Agriculture to estimate the payments each farm was eligible to receive from the 2018 and 2019 Market Facilitation Program. We find that farms with a White operator were eligible to receive significantly larger payments than farms with a non-White operator. Most of the disparity forfarms with a Black operator is due to differences in average farm size, since there are few large farms with a Black operator. The disparities for farms with an operator of other races were roughly half due to farm size and half due to the location of these farms and the types of commodities they tend to produce},

—Michel-Rolph Trouillot, Silencing the Past, p. 27
On October 13, 1965, the New Farmers of America (NFA) disappeared without a trace. The organization had operationalized one of the largest Black youth farm movements in American history and boasted a membership of over 50,000 Black farm boys studying vocational agriculture in public high schools in 18 states across the South and parts of the East Coast. They were last seen in the shad­ows of the Jim Crow era, participating in the national convention of the majority-white Future Farmers of America (FFA)—now named the National FFA Organization—in Kansas City, Missouri. At the convention, a ceremony took place that symbolized the July 1, 1965, decision to merge the NFA and FFA. But for some, as one former member told me, the “merger” was more like a “hostile takeover.” The “pageantry of the merger,” as Cecil L. Strickland, Sr. (1994, p. 44) described it, required Adolphus Pinson, the NFA’s last president, to surrender the organization’s char­ter to Kenneth Kennedy, the national FFA presi­dent. “I am duly authorized to transfer to you the National NFA Charter, together with the perma­nent record of officers of the organization,” Pinson told Kennedy. “Also, to inform you that the total membership of 50,807 students of vocational agri­culture in 12 states are now active members of the Future Farmers of America” (Strickland, 1994, p. 43). The NFA charter was placed in the national FFA archives along with the minutes of the last NFA convention and important cultural artifacts of the organization, including its banner and flag. The NFA also transferred the US\$20,000 in its savings account to the FFA treasury. The final nail in the coffin for the NFA occurred when Pinson took off his NFA jacket and handed it to Kennedy. In return, Kennedy presented Pinson with an FFA jacket, declaring, “The exchanging of this NFA jacket for the FFA jacket by you, the last NFA President, symbolizes the joining together all stu­dents of vocational agriculture into one great organization” (Strickland, 1994, p. 46). And with Kennedy’s final statement, the NFA vanished. . . .},

	abstract = {This paper estimates the short- and long-run effects of universities on geographic clustering of economic activity, labor market composition and local productivity and presents evidence of local spillovers from universities. I treat the designation of land-grant universities in the 1860s as a natural experiment after controlling for the confounding factors with a combination of synthetic control methods and event-study analyses. Three key results are obtained. First, the designation increased local population density by 6 percent within 10years and 45 percent in 80years. Second, the designation did not change the relative size of local manufacturing sector. Third, the designation enhanced local manufacturing output per worker by \$2136 (1840 dollars; 57 percent) in 80years while the short-run effects were negligible. This positive effect on the productivity in non-education sectors suggests the existence of local spillovers from universities. Over an 80-year horizon, my results indicate that the increase in manufacturing productivity reflects both the impact of direct spillovers from universities and general agglomeration economies that arise from the increase in population.},

That focus on creating opportunity on challenging, non-irrigable terrain presents a striking contradiction to the firsthand experiences of the western legislators who argued in support of the bill. Elected representatives from these districts justified larger acreages by candidly acknowledging the geophysical realities of the western landscape—those climatic and topographic conditions that were the most frequently cited challenges to settlers in the West—even as they argued that land law should be made more flexible to support new farms and ranches. Adapting to the limits of the western landscape became a paramount goal of legislators who drafted federal land policy, ultimately contributing to expanding the reach of the expert and interventionist state and signaling a new era in regional development.},

	abstract = {Blacks have been farming in the USA for about four centuries and in Michigan since the 1830s. Yet, for blacks, owning and retaining farmland has been a continuous challenge. This historical analysis uses environmental justice and food sovereignty frameworks to examine the farming experiences of blacks in the USA generally, and more specifically in Michigan. It analyzes land loss, the precipitous decline in the number of black farmers, and the strategies that blacks have used to counteract these phenomena. The paper shows that the ability of blacks to own and operate farms has been negatively impacted by lack of access to credit, segregation, relegation to marginal and hazard-prone land, natural disasters, organized opposition to black land ownership, and systemic discrimination. The paper examines the use of cooperatives and other community-based organizations to help blacks respond to discrimination and environmental inequalities. The paper assesses how the farming experiences of blacks in Michigan compare to the experiences of black farmers elsewhere. It also explores the connections between Michigan’s black farmers, southern black farmer cooperatives, and Detroit’s black consumers.},
